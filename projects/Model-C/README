std-imp-doc.csv is the output from running:
 grep -ne "DOC\|IMP\|STD" *.[hc]

in the Model Implementation C Checker source directory.

Every condition (i.e., if/while/case-label) in the source of the C compiler
was commented with:

   STD a reference to the C Standard
   IMP was intended to be a reference to an implementation document
   DOC is a documentation issue

All the wording in the C Standard should be referenced from the
source of the implementation.

Unreferenced lines include section headers, forward references, etc.
