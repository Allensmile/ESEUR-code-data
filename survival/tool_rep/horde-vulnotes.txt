SNAPSHOT	DOCUMENTED	COMMIT NOTES
11	NO	"Mike: worked on cleaning up the menus  problem reporting  and signups after the move last night.  Made these changes:  o Fixed the ""\r\n"" wrapping bug in the problem report  o Disabused the ""all done"" redirects of any module knowledge. it now    takes a ""return_url"" parameter and will send you to that when done.  o Fixed multiple append trailer/footer bugs.  o Fixed a variable naming bug so your work is saved if you had already    typed a problem report but forgot something  causing a redisplay  o Incorrect variable names and program descriptors for versioning  o abstracted the mailfrom command and set_env_in_string command to the    horde library since it was used in 3 different places without change.    updated horde.config  build.pl and buildlib.pl to reflect this and build    correctly "
90	NO	- The MimePartData class is now officially defunct - Moved the attachment-gathering code in compose.php3 into an addMimeParts()   function to avoid code duplication. - Got rid of some code duplication in message.php3 by calling   mime_view_text() for text
93	NO	- Removing signup.php3. It's out of date  and we need something that works with phplib.  - Converting horde.php3 over to the $horde[][] conf system. 
194	NO	Log.php     Added priorityToString()  which maps the LOG_* constants to their     string representation  Log/file.php     Rename Log/logfile.php to Log/file.php     Check for a valid file handle before attempting to write to the logfile     Use Log::priorityToString()  Log/sql.php     Use Log::priorityToString() 
249	NO	removing  now that the latest rev is in cvs. 
271	NO	Initial commit of the new help subsystem.  This implementation is much cleaner than the previous system.  It also has the advantage of being XML-based.  Note than the help sources are nowhere near populated or complete right now. 
335	YES	HTTP_Cache:: now compresses content without the use of a temp file  makes sure that implicit_flush is off  and some other cleanup. 
359	YES	remove our mailfrom() function in favor of the Mail:: interface now in PEAR. 
412	YES	Remove Log::. It is part of PEAR now. 
416	YES	Clean up the problem reporting a bit more and pass the name value from preferences to it from IMP.  We need Mail_RFC822::writeAddress() to really make this correct  but I'll implement that in a bit. 
427	NO	"Documentation commit - put all classes into a @package  and fix some other documentation bits. But there is a LOT more left to do here. The results of running PHPDoc against the current tree are at http://chuck.bitgroup.com/api/; if everyone can chip in with their pieces (like Anil  I'll leave the Chora stuff to you  probably)  it shouldn't be too bad. "
428	NO	Woof:  - break core Horde classes (Lang  Secret  ObjectStore (renamed from   SessionCache)  etc. out into their own files. - include them where necessary  usually in an app's lib/base.php file. - core package names are all now lowercase. - a bit more documentation work  but that's mostly to come. - classes all now follow a convention of capitalizing words and acronyms - documentation is updated accordingly - logic is built in to the factory() methods to account for case in driver   names. 
434	YES	make help work with register_globals = Off. 
490	YES	Here ya go: update your imp/config/prefs.php  edit away  and see prefs appear and disappear  change from numbers to textareas to text boxes to...  Yeah. It all works. I need to put change_password back in somehow  but that's minor. Have fun. 
501	NO	make factory-generated subclasses lowercase.  Bug: Submitted by: 
517	NO	Improved  more modular PHP version testing code.  I've regression-tested this against all released versions of PHP4 so I think we're set now. 
585	NO	rename ObjectStore to SessionCache and Connection to Token 
644	NO	Add a framework-level base.php file and make framework scripts use it. This will ensure that framework-level pages are translated  etc. 
666	YES	Cleanup: change all the $conf['paths'] variables to query this information from the registry using the new API functions:  getTemplatePath()  getWebRoot()  getFileRoot()  getGraphicsPath()  Update your config files! 
718	NO	Cleaned up the help system a bit.

938	NO	Copyright year update. 
967	NO	not needed

1304	NO	VFS file driver fixes  including automatic creation of directories. 
1306	NO	fix typo 
1315	NO	Submitted by: Michael Cochrane <mike@graftonhall.co.nz> All handling of listing zip files is handled with 100% PHP code  instead of an external program  in the MIME_Viewer object.

1319	NO	Submitted by: Michael Cochrane <mike@graftonhall.co.nz> Tar/gzip now handled entirely internally by MIME_Viewer. 
1413	NO	"Alright  I give up... enscript just doesn't work on my machine; I think it wants a shell or something. But  this should clean the viewer up a bit and use one less temp file. "
1557	NO	Add VFS::writeData()  which takes raw data instead of a tmp file  which will sometimes be more efficient. 
1694	NO	javascript-based colorpicker  Submitted by: Mike Cochrane <mike@graftonhall.co.nz>

2203	NO	Adopt Data_tsv:: to the new Data framework. 
2208	YES	Let's see here... Removed some code in Horde_Crypt_smime that was PGP specific - marked that function as incomplete. Various cleanups/phpdoc/private variables everywhere. Now  Horde will not output a fatal error if the openssl extension is not available. Made IMP_SMIME extend Horde_Crypt_smime. Display raw signed message if S/MIME support is not available (either turned off or no OpenSSL support). 
2458	NO	More strtolower() replacements. 
2461	NO	Move setup.php into /admin 
2633	YES	Submitted by: Chris Hastie <lists@oak-wood.co.uk> Improved handling of PGP packet information. PEAR::isError -> is_a(). No need to number any of the file pointer variables. 
2707	NO	Various cleanups/modifications - mainly to make the various MIME_Viewers more consistent with each other. 
2751	NO	- Horde_CLI:: library for common command-line tasks. - Split Horde_Scheduler:: out into a driver model. - add a cron driver. - add an example crond script. 
2869	YES	Add check for Auth_SASL. Submitted by: Chris Hastie <lists@oak-wood.co.uk> 
2874	NO	Don't set PO-Revision-Date. It produces too much one line changes. 
2914	NO	silence some errors. We *really* need a clean Horde request lib. 
2929	YES	Use PEAR's HTTP_Request for XMLRPC requests and simplify request() signature. 
2969	YES	- Move Cache_session to Horde_SessionObjects - the semantics just aren't the same as the rest of the Cache drivers.  - Rename Cache:: to Horde_Cache:: for consistency/packaging.  - The Horde_Cache:: API is completely revamped to be more flexible/easy to u
2984	YES	"Don't show a red ""No"" for MIME magic if we're PHP <= 4.2.x and can't get it. Remove some nulls that somehow got in here. "

3063	YES	Fix connection timeouts for PGP keyserver lookups. The add to keyserver probably still needs to be tweaked some more though. 
3076	NO	Clean up and add some new VFS functionality.  Submitted by: Jeff Graves <jeff@image-src.com>

3449	NO	Use Horde_CLI. 
3450	NO	Some fixes. Use System::mkdir(). 
3451	NO	Use PEAR::File_Find for file searching. 
3612	YES	Remove use of the file() binary for MIME_Magic. 1) it seems like Chuck's PHP based solution matches the same files as the function based solution  and 2) I guess there is a pretty big security risk for versions of file() before 3.41 - see http://www.idefense.com/advisory/03.04.03.txt Cleaned up some of the code also. 
3643	NO	 =- Clean up cron code a lot - start implementing config caching in whups scheduler.
3699	NO	" =- add a set of functions for loading a named piece of image data; then operate on that data  instead of passing The data to every function"

3927	NO	the image display script now with editing functions too

4500	NO	Move cipher test. 
4533	NO	"get some test files  and rearrange a few things. What package some of these classes fall under is entirely debatable; I just want to get everything into a structure that can be worked with. "

4729	NO	Move Horde_Data to framework.

5126	NO	Add feature to save translation statistics as a serialized array to a local file. 
5190	NO	not useful for much of anything 
5347	NO	No longer needed. 
5361	NO	No need for this anymore. 
5470	NO	browse a level of subdirectories 
5526	NO	Go ahead and just use the constants STDIN/STDERR/STDOUT since  in PHP 4.3.0+  they are pre-defined and pre-opened. 
5713	NO	rip out useless stuff from this  all this script does now is prep the minimum possible for the web install to continue 
5734	NO	Try to clean this up a bit.  Karsten  first  this shouldn't be in the portal  it should go directly under services/ if anywhere (should probably be just a custom prefs pane). Second  what's the reason for the links to cvs.horde.org here? 
5741	NO	Test for XML_Serializer Bug: 2805 Submitted by: kevin_myer (at) iu13 (dot) org 
5743	NO	PHP 5.0.x should be stable enough by now to remove this warning.

5853	NO	Implement some of Roel's suggestion  move the welcome text out of the Add Content row.

5991	NO	Move mime_mapping build scripts into the developer tools package.
