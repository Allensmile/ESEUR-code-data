** Not all of the files compile.  Some are just waaay too messed up.
** Here are a list of the files:

scan0032.cpp - Can't figure out what's wrong with this one.
               I'm not very well versed in C++, so I need some help.

scan0018.cpp - The original scan file (SCAN0018.jpg) is a mess.
               Put that with my limited C++ knowledge and it makes
               it very difficult.

scan0022.c   - This is by far the most difficult file I've had to read.
               The code starts on SCAN0023.jpg.  This one's really screwed up.

** The rest should compile :)
