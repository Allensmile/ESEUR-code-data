The code and data used to create the examples in "Empirical Software Engineering using R" by Derek M. Jones.  Available in pdf form later in the year and dead tree form hopefully early next year.

To install all of the R library packages used by this code type:

source("install.R")

at the R command line.

All programs read the file: ESEUR_config.r.  Put a copy of this file in what R considers to be its home directory.

This file sets the variable ESEUR_dir to contain the base directory containing all the code+data.  The default value is R's home directory.

[Blog post](http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2012/06/22/background-to-my-book-project-empirical-software-engineering-with-r/) giving some background on the book.

If you know of any software engineering data that you think should be included, please let me know.
